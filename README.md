- 👋 Hi, I’m @AP-IS
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning to code + CS for a future career in CS!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python, and will be branching out soon hopefully
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment, just looking to learn the basics currently
- 📫 How to reach me ... not exactly someone worth collaborating with atm, so probably not something you'll need to worry about
